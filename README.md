# Typescript User Directory

This is a full stack Typescript application using Vue and Express.

## Development

You can spin up the application by running:

```bash
$ npm i 
$ npm start
```

If you prefer to keep the Vite and Express logs separate, you can do so by running both applications separately.

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run start:vite
$ npm run start:express # In a separate terminal
```

## Production

To build the application for a deployment run:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This will build both the server and client code to `dist-client` and `dist-server` respectively.
